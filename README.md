# Statistical Inference & Machine Learning on DAX and EURO STOXX Futures

> **Research status:** In progress — framework prepared, empirical results pending.

---

## Overview

This project investigates whether statistically grounded and machine-learning-derived signals can generate **exploitable predictive power** on **DAX (FDAX)** and **EURO STOXX 50 (FESX)** futures, after accounting for transaction costs, temporal dependence, and out-of-sample robustness.

The work follows a rigorous **quantitative research methodology**: baseline statistical models are established first, then progressively more complex ML estimators are introduced and compared under a strict **walk-forward validation** framework. All performance claims must withstand empirical scrutiny across multiple market regimes.

---

## Research Questions

1. Do lagged returns, volatility, and momentum features contain statistically significant predictive information on DAX/EURO STOXX futures at daily (and/or intraday) frequencies?
2. How do ML classifiers and regressors compare against naive and linear baselines after controlling for data-snooping and look-ahead bias?
3. Does predictive performance degrade materially once realistic transaction costs and slippage are incorporated?
4. To what extent is performance regime-dependent (trending vs. mean-reverting, low vs. high volatility, stress vs. calm)?
5. Is there a meaningful performance differential between DAX and EURO STOXX signals, and can cross-asset features add value?

---

## Objectives

- Build a **reproducible, auditable pipeline** from raw data to evaluated trading signals.
- Establish statistically sound **baselines** before introducing any ML complexity.
- Apply **proper temporal cross-validation** (walk-forward) to avoid look-ahead contamination.
- Measure performance using both **predictive** (accuracy, hit ratio) and **financial** (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, turnover) metrics.
- Conduct a **regime-conditional analysis** to assess robustness and generalizability.
- Produce a report suitable for **academic submission** or **portfolio presentation**.

## Assets Studied

| Asset | Full Name | Exchange | Denomination |
|---|---|---|---|
| FDAX | DAX Futures | Eurex | EUR |
| FESX | EURO STOXX 50 Futures | Eurex | EUR |

Both contracts are among the most liquid European equity index futures, with tight spreads and high notional volume, making them suitable candidates for systematic strategy research.

## Working Hypotheses

> These are **research hypotheses to be tested**, not conclusions.

- **H1 (Predictability):** Short-horizon returns of FDAX/FESX are not fully random; some statistical structure is detectable.
- **H2 (ML vs. Linear):** Non-linear models (tree-based ensembles) capture patterns not captured by linear baselines.
- **H3 (Costs):** After accounting for bid-ask spread and commission, alpha is significantly reduced or eliminated for high-frequency signals.
- **H4 (Regimes):** Model performance varies significantly across volatility regimes and trend/mean-reversion periods.
- **H5 (Cross-asset):** DAX and EURO STOXX signals exhibit partial co-movement, and cross-asset features may enhance prediction.

## Limitations

- All conclusions are contingent on the quality and completeness of the input data.
- In-sample model selection introduces implicit bias; walk-forward validation mitigates but does not eliminate this.
- Transaction cost models are simplified; actual execution costs may differ significantly.
- The project does not model market impact, order book dynamics, or intraday liquidity constraints.
- Past statistical regularities may not persist in future market regimes.
- No guarantee of out-of-sample performance is implied by any in-sample result.
